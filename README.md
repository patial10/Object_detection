# Object_detection
This is end-to-end web application where users can upload the image file and get result coressponding to that input image file.this appllication based on the coco images dataset where around 1000 images are pre-trained.here's the my approch to build it:
1. Download pre-trained weights of yolov4
2. Load pre-trained yolo model
3. Pass input image to yolo model and get result 
4. Deploy the model
